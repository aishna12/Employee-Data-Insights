## Introduction
Data stored in the Database [file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3czfpe0njsq868q/employees_mod.sql?dl=0) has been used to solve various data analysis tasks to give insights to the concerned stakeholders in a company about data of the empoloyees working at the company. A tableau dashboard has been created depicting the combined result of all the tasks.

<!-- SOFTWARE USED -->
## Software Used
* **MySQL Workbench**: To write queries inorder to obtain the corresponding data to solve various tasks.
*  **Tableau Public Desktop**: To visiualize the obtained results for the task

## Tasks
* **Task 1 : A visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.** 


 ` SELECT \
    YEAR(d.from_date) AS calendar_year, \
    e.gender, \
    COUNT(e.emp_no) AS num_of_employees
FROM
    t_employees e
        JOIN
    t_dept_emp d ON d.emp_no = e.emp_no
GROUP BY calendar_year , e.gender
HAVING calendar_year >= 1990
ORDER BY calendar_year ASC; `

* **Task 2: Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.**


` SELECT d.dept_name, ee.gender , dm.emp_no, dm.from_date, dm.to_date, e.calendar_year,
CASE 
	WHEN YEAR(dm.to_date) >=e.calendar_year AND YEAR(dm.from_date) <= calendar_year THEN 1 ELSE 0
END AS if_active
FROM
	(SELECT YEAR(hire_date) as calendar_year FROM t_employees GROUP BY calendar_year) e 
CROSS JOIN t_dept_manager dm JOIN t_departments d ON dm.dept_no = d.dept_no 
							JOIN 	t_employees ee ON dm.emp_no = ee.emp_no 
                            ORDER BY dm.emp_no, calendar_year; `
                            
* **Task 3: Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.**


` SELECT 
    e.gender,
    d.dept_name,
    ROUND(AVG(s.salary), 2) AS salary,
    YEAR(s.from_date) AS calendar_year
FROM
    t_salaries s
        JOIN
    t_employees e ON s.emp_no = e.emp_no
        JOIN
    t_dept_emp de ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
        JOIN
    t_departments d ON d.dept_no = de.dept_no
GROUP BY d.dept_no , e.gender , calendar_year
HAVING calendar_year <= 2002
ORDER BY d.dept_no;  `

* **Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.**

CREATE PROCEDURE filter_salary (IN p_min_salary FLOAT, IN p_max_salary FLOAT)

SELECT 
    e.gender, d.dept_name, AVG(s.salary) as avg_salary

        JOIN

    WHERE s.salary BETWEEN p_min_salary AND p_max_salary
